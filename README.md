## Teaching Myself the Go Language by Writing my Favorite Game
![Game Board](https://github.com/DennisFaucher/godaleks/blob/main/images/godaleks-v0.3.png)
## Why
I have a habit of learning new programming languages by trying to recreate favorite games. I learned to program in color in PC-COBOL around 1987 by recreating the classic Tetris game in PC-COBOL. I learned to program in C around 1989 by recreating the classic [Daleks](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/daleks-forever) game. 

## How
Trying my recreation of Daleks is easy:
1. Install the Go language on your computer from [this site](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Install the termbox screen control Go library using this command "go get -u github.com/nsf/termbox-go"
3. Download the godaleks-v*.go from this repo
4. Run the game using "go run godaleks-v*.go" (v0.1 = one level, no scores. v0.2 = infinite levels, scoring, larger board. v0.3 = high score file)

### Game Play
Arrows to move, s for Sonic Screwdriver (one per level), t for Teleport (1 per level), . to stand in one place, ESC to Quit

## Notes
Never finished, but working. Since the game is finally playable, I thought I would throw the code out in a repo.

## Thank You
Thanks for trying this out. I hope you find the code educational, if not rudimentry. I used [this guide](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) to learn Go.
